(Da da dada....)
Woke up today
feelin' less than great
Got my work done late, oh
(Screw these deadlines!!)
Missed the train, two hour wait
And I barely ate
(...Just what is my life?)
Seems like everybody's got it
all figured out
No matter where the hell I go
I always end up
getting lost somehow
The spark guiding
my way is slowly fizzing out...
Everynight in my bed
I look up to the stars
'Cuz I know what it's like to be
so close and yet so far, oh
All these thoughts in my head
And I fight that mental war
'Cuz I really need to know
I need to know!
I need you now!!
I need you!!!
I'mma need you to
understand that
I can be a handful,
hard to handle
Down in flames everything
I touch
Is it a scandal if you try and
Screw it up sometimes?
I don't need
your guidance or advice
I know I'm right where
I want to be
(I'll find..) My way
But all the people say
I'm a mess
I'm a mess
I'm a mess
I'm a mess
So what?! a mess
That's what
I like about me best!
Ayyye,
why don't we throw the dice?
Let's see what kinda trouble
we could get into tonight
I like a little chaos
in my life, that's right
What's with all this sugar
Let me add a little spice,
yeah?
Seems like everybody's got it
all figured out
Well, ain't that good for them?
'Cuz so have I by now
It's my journey to take
and I will find my route
Now when I go to bed
And I look up at the stars
I feel a sense of calm
in knowing
That there's something
much greater than us
And dont'cha think the point
of life is having fun?
'Cuz I really need to know
I need to know!
I need you now!!
I need you!!!
I'mma need you to
understand that
I can be a handful,
hard to handle
Down in flames everything
I touch
Is it a scandal if you try?
No, no, no, no...
I realized that
all I needed has been
right here by my side
All this time..
All this time...
All this time....
HEY!!!
I can be a handful,
hard to handle
Down in flames everything
I touch
Is it a scandal if you try and
Screw it up sometimes?
I don't need
your guidance or advice
I know I'm right where
I want to be
(I'll find..) My way
Too bad,
you thought you got me chained
Now I'm flying, can't be tamed
Let the wind carry away
my thoughts and
I know now I'm free
And you doubted that I would
Now I showed you that I could!
