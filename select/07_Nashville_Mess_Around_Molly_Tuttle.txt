Just rolled in from Fond du Lac, I'm looking for some fun
Going down to Nashville town, see the ponies run
Just rolled in from Fond du Lac, sing a little diddy
Raise some hell and giddy all the way down in Music City

It's blooming down in Nashville, let's go light up the town
Raise a glass and drink it fast before they bust it down
Shine up your shoes, come on let's do the Nashville mess around
Yodel-ayy-hey, yodel-ayy-ho, yodel-ayy-hee

It's hard to hit the honky-tonks if you ain't got a dollar
And if your banjo's out of tune, the girls won't hoot and holler
No they won't even clap their hands unless you are somebody
Not some Jack from Fond du Lac who drank up all his money

It's blooming down in Nashvillе, let's go light up the town
Raise a glass and drink it fast bеfore they bust it down
Shine up your shoes, come on let's do the Nashville mess around
Yodel-ayy-hey, yodel-ayy-ho, yodel-ayy-hee

So wipe house and pilgrims, and in from out of towners
We had a boom now there's no room so don't you hang around here
You're out of luck so don't pick up when Nashville comes a calling
You best go back to Fond du Lac and and quit your honky talking

It's blooming down in Nashville, let's go light up the town
Raise a glass and drink it fast before they bust it down
Shine up your shoes, come on let's do the Nashville mess around
Yodel-ayy-hey, yodel-ayy-ho, yodel-ayy-hee

Who's ready to party in Nashville? (Woo)
