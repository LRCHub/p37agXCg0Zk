Now your brother's gone you've been coming around
You're a little bit young, but a little bit pretty so I guess that's fine
You wanna mess around?
Yeah I guess that's fine
We'll mess around

You'll make me smile just you wait and see
Your body will be found before your hair can grow
Grow out long
Long white fingernails
Push 'em down

Turn your head around
