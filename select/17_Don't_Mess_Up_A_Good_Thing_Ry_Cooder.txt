(O. Sain)

Good thing, good thing, good thing
You been cheating on me, now, baby
You know I know it's true
Ain't nobody in this whole wide world
Gonna love you like I do
Don't you be no fool, don't you be no fool
Gonna keep on fooling 'round now, baby
Gonna mess up a good thing
Gonna mess up a good thing, all right

Well, I might of cheated just a little bit baby
Like many others do
But when I get my little old paycheck now
It goes right back to you
Don't you be no fool, don't you be no fool
'Cause if you keep on fooling around now, baby
Gonna mess up a good thing, you're going to mess up a good thing

They tell me you got a part-time lover
Who's living way cross town
It won't be but a little while, baby
Before you put me down
Don't you be no fool, don't you be no fool
Gonna keep on fooling 'round now, baby
Gonna mess up a good thing
Gonna mess up a good thing, all right

Let me tell you something
Now, don't you go sneaking across town, baby
To catch me doing wrong
Don't you know everybody's jealous, baby
'Cause we got a thing going on
Don't you be no fool, don't you be no fool
If you keep on fooling 'round now baby
Gonna mess up a good thing
Gonna mess up a good thing

Good thing [You're messing up a good thing]
Messing up a good thing
Good thing
Good thing
