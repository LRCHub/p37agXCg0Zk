You must have thought my love was for fun, honey
You tried to spend it like a dollar, ah
You got the right string, baby yeah
But your yo-yo is the wrong color

Now honey, let me tell you
Don't you mess with Cupid, no-no, ah
Cupid, he's not stupid, baby huh
Don't you mess with Cupid, no-no, ah
Oh, Cupid, he's not stupid, man, no ah, yeah

You thought my love was just a rug on the floor, honey
Just to walk on and nothing more, baby
You just don't seem to understand
That I'm a man, baby, and a full-grown man

Honey, I'll tell you
Don't you mess with Cupid, no-no ah
Cupid, he's not stupid, baby ah
Don't you mess with Cupid, baby ah
Cupid, he's not stupid, no-no-no-no-no

When I look for you, you're never home, honey
Like a lamp, you turn me off and on, baby ah
But like a shade that dims the light
When it's opened, I can't do nothing right
I'm warning you, baby
Don't you mess with this Cupid, no-no yeah
Baby, he's not stupid, no-no-no

Don't mess with me
Damn you, don't mess with me
I'm happy as a man, baby, full-grown man
I don't want you to get mess with me
Don't quit on my life, honey
Don't play with cupid, baby
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
I got to tell you, baby
Don't play it on about it, honey
I'm not going fool for ya
I'm just a guy
